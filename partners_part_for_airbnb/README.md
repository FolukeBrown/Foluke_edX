This project is the first step towards building a full web application: the AirBnB clone.

It is very important because it serves as the back-end base of other projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration…

Synopsis
The Console

This software is a command interpreter similar to a Linux shell but limited to a specific use-case; management of objects in the AirBnB Clone:

Creating new objects (ex: a new User or a new Place)
Retrieving an object from a file, a database etc…
Doing operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
Updating attributes of an object
Destroying an object
It can work in two different modes:

Interactive and Non-interactive.

In Interactive mode, the console will display a prompt (hbnb) indicating that the user can write and execute a command. After the command is run, the prompt will appearagain a wait for a new command. This can go indefinitely as long as the user does not exit the program.

$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit

(hbnb) 
(hbnb) 
(hbnb) quit
$

In Non-interactive mode, the shell will need to be run with a command input piped into its execution so that the command is run as soon as the Shell starts. In this mode no prompt will appear, and no further input will be expected from the user.

$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$
$ cat test_help
help
$
$ cat test_help | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$

Format of Command Input
In order to give commands to the console, these will need to be piped through an echo in case of Non-interactive mode.
Interactive Mode the commands will need to be written with a keyboard when the prompt appears and will be recognized when an enter key is pressed (new line). As soon as this happens, the console will attempt to execute the command through several means or will show an error message if the command didn't run successfully. In this mode, the console can be exited using the CTRL + D combination, CTRL + C, or the command quit or EOF.


Arguments
Most commands have several options or arguments that can be used when executing the program. In order for the Shell to recognize those parameters, the user must separate everything with spaces.

Example:

user@ubuntu:~/AirBnB$ ./console.py
(hbnb) create BaseModel
49faff9a-6318-451f-87b6-910505c55907
user@ubuntu:~/AirBnB$ ./console.py


OR

user@ubuntu:~/AirBnB$ ./console.py $ echo "create BaseModel" | ./console.py
(hbnb)
e37ebcd3-f8e1-4c1f-8095-7a019070b1fa
(hbnb)
user@ubuntu:~/AirBnB$ ./console.py
