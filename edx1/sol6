Your friend is having a lot of difficulties with multiplication tables. He's having the most trouble with the multiples of 8 table, and asks you to send him the multiples of 8 table so that he can learn it more easily. To do this, you decide to write a program that prints the multiples of 8 table. Because you will use your code again in the future to print other multiplication tables, you decide to use a loop and only one print statement.

Your program must use the following format to print the multiples of 8 table (be careful with spaces):

0x8 = 0
1x8 = 8
...
10x8 = 80
Warning: Your program will not be reusable in the near future if you don't use a loop. You must use a loop to print the multiplication table.

solution.

#include<stdio.h>
int main(void){
    int i;
    int number = 0;
    int multiplyBy = 8;
    int result = 0;
    for(i =0; i<11; i++){
        printf("%dx%d = %d\n", number, multiplyBy, result);
        number = number + 1;
        result = number * multiplyBy;
    }
    
    
 return 0;   
}
