You just started learning a new language and decide to buy a few books to practice. Thankfully you quickly find a book seller who offers every book for the same low fixed price. You have a certain amount of money and you would like to know how many books of the same price you can purchase.

Please write a C-program that starts by reading the amount of money you have (which may be a double), then reads the price per book (which again may be a double). The program should then display an integer, namely the largest number of books that you can purchase with the given amount of money.

#include<stdio.h>
int main(void){
    double money;
    double pricePer;
    double books;
    int manyBooks;
    scanf("%lf\n", &money);
    scanf("%lf\n", &pricePer);
    books = money / pricePer;
    
    manyBooks = (int)books;
    
    printf("%d\n", manyBooks);
    
    return 0;
}
